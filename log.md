# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started doing the "HTML5 and CSS" section of "Front End Development Certification" from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**: It seemed very easy and I didn't not find it interesting or challenging at all. Finished 5h task in 1.2h. Decided to skip all the tasks without [*] sign on them. These are reqiored for FEDC.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the "Build a Tribute Page".

**Thoughts:**: Nothing special. Very easy task. Had to do it as it is a requirement for the "Front End Development Certification"

### Day 2: February 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started doing a simple portfolio template and make it available for anyone on gitHub.

**Thoughts:**: Spend too much time figuring out the UI of the application and at the end just went with Materialize tabs.
