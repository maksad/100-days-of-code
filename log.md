# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started doing the "HTML5 and CSS" section of "Front End Development Certification" from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**: It seemed very easy and I didn't not find it interesting or challenging at all. Finished 5h task in 1.2h. Decided to skip all the tasks without [*] sign on them. These are reqiored for FEDC.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the "Build a Tribute Page".

**Thoughts:**: Nothing special. Very easy task. Had to do it as it is a requirement for the "Front End Development Certification"

### Day 2: February 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started doing a simple portfolio template and make it available for anyone on gitHub.

**Thoughts:**: Spend too much time figuring out the UI of the application and at the end just went with Materialize tabs.

### Day 4: February 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the simple static portfolio page and moved to fun part - " Basic Algorithm Scripting".

**Thoughts:**: The portfolio page took more time than I was willing to spend on it. The main reason was figuring out how it should look like.
Though it's simple it still requires some css stylings.

### Day 6: February 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did most of the "Algorithm Scripting" section of "Front End Development Certification" from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**: This was interesting to do. It reminded me of the time when I was just learning algorithms at university and do similar exercises at uva.onlinejudge.org

### Day 7: February 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued with "Algorithm Scripting" section of "Front End Development Certification" from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**: Realized that early morning coding after partying and without a coffee is very unproductive. Spend 1h to finish the "Chunky Monkey" code

### Day 8: February 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: My one hour of code turned into 2.5h, but eventually finished the "Algorithm Scripting" section from freeCodeCamp.
