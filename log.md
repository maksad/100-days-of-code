**Today's Progress**: Started doing the "HTML5 and CSS" section of "Front End Development Certification" from freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:**: It seemed very easy and I didn't not find it interesting or challenging at all. Finished 5h task in 1.2h. Decided to skip all the tasks without [*] sign on them. These are reqiored for FEDC.
